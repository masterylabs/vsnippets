Couple of quick notes also...

If you ever see a video on YouTube
that would be beneficial to your audience,
you can simply drag it into your WP Admin,
to create a brand new post.

And.. if you are short on time, and
need fresh content for your website,
simply drag and drop a YouTube video
using VSnippets, and you're done!

You can also use this for brand new
websites to quickly populate it with
content, without doing any of the
heavy lifting yourself.

Watch this quick 4 minute video that shows 
you the entire system and how you can
do this too.
